# ReactJS Web

This repository holds the source code of a **reference** for the development of a **React.js web** written mainly in javascript.

## Before start

## Architecture design

The reference uses a architecure based on [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview.html) and a Generic Model View Controller pattern.

### Overview

![alt architecture](./public/images/architecture.jpg)

### Description

The architecture uses the following structure:

-  /actions: Handle data operations such as CRUD actions
  > This component is the responsible of manage connection to REST APIs, websockets, etc.
-  /components: Handle DOM rendering and event definition.
-  /containers: Handle the connection between actions and components (data & views).
  > All containers must have a component, but components donâ€™t necessarily require a container.
-  /reducers: Represents the link between actions and containers through updates of states (data & states).
-  /styles: Handle DOM styling (e.g. colors, dimensions, etc.).

### To start coding and build:

-  Clone this repository.
-  Install dependencies.
```bash
$ npm install
```

-  Run server.
```bash
$ npm start
```

### Examples

-   Request example. 
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000
```


## Deploy to aws eb

### Create an elastic beanstalk instance
